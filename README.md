# auth0-configuration-manager

Simple script to backup and restore auth0 configurations for tenant sync

Each tenant configuration contains the full spec. Since this might include secrets, all the clients configuration files are stored in git encrypted leveraging [SOPS: Secrets OPerationS](https://github.com/mozilla/sops).

- A terminal session authenticated with AWS services account (this account contains the encryption key needed to encrypt/decrypt SOPS)
- Configure the local dot env files to avoid leaking secrets
  - [.env.dev.local]
  - [.env.production.local]
